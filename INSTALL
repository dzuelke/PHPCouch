PHPCouch Installation Instructions
==================================

Requirements
------------
PHPCouch requires PHP 5.3.0 or later.

External dependencies
---------------------
PHPCouch does not require external libraries or non-standard extensions at runtime.

PHPCouch can optionally use one of the following dependencies to perform HTTP requests:

- Zend_Http_Client, shipping with Zend Framework (version 1.8.2 or later), or
- the pecl/http PHP extension
- the curl PHP extension

If you would like to run PHPCouch's Unit Tests, you need PHPUnit 3.3 or later installed. Zend_Http_Client is used for the unit tests, so you need Zend Framework (see above).

Setting up
----------
To use PHPCouch, simply include lib/phpcouch/Phpcouch.php and call Phpcouch::boostrap().

After that, PHPCouch is ready for action. Refer to the documentation to learn how to get started by registering a connection etc.
